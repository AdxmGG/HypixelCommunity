# Duels

Duels is an extremely popular gamemode on Hypixel due to the different modes you can play.

Duels is a quick paced, competitive gamemode where you fight one or more players in order to win the match.

## Modes

Duels is well known for having a variaty of different modes to play with. There are over twenty two different modes to choose from.

Examples include Classic, SkyWars, UHC, OP, and Bridge duels. Each gamemode differs in team size and kits, making each mode completely different than eachother.

## Battle Arena

In every Duels lobby, there is a battle arena behind the NPCs. This is a large area where players are given all iron armour with protection two, and a diamond sword. 

This is an area to warm up before you enter a match. It allows you to practice without jeprodisring your stats. 

## Block Hitting

One of the best ways to win a match of duels is to block hit.

Block hitting is when you hit your opponent, but block with your sword at the same time. This acheives much more knockback than if you were to not block hit. Not only does it knock your opponent back more, it also results in less damage to you.
