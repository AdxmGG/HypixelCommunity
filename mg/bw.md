# BedWars

BedWars is one of the most popular minigames on Hypixel. 

The aim of the game is to destroy other teams' beds, while protecting your own. While the team still has their bed, they can respawn. However, once their bed is broken they can no longer respawn once killed and will be elmiinted. 

You have only one goal, be the last team standing.

## Generators

There are three generators within the map: the generator at your base \(forge\); the generator in-between your base and mid, and the generators at mid.

The generator at your base spawns iron ingots and gold, which can be used to purchase items in the Item Shop NPC.

The generator in-between your base and mid spawns diamonds, which can be used to purcahse team upgrades in the Team Upgrades NPC.

The generators at mid spawn emeralds, which can be used to purchase the best items in the Item Shop NPC.

## Shop NPCs

There are two shop NPCs in BedWars, the Item Shop and the Team Upgrades shop.

The Item Shop allows you to buy the essential items you need to play the game, such as wool to build, better swords to fight, wood to protect your base, and eventually potions and enderpearls to fight. Most things in this shop can be purchased using iron and gold, however the best items require emerald.

The Team Upgrades shop allows you to buy upgrades that benefit the entire team. All upgrades are purchased using diamonds. Upgrades include things such as sharpened swords, reinforced armour, and a better base generator.

## Modes

There are six gamemodes at the time of writing: solo, doubles, `3v3v3`, `4v4v4v4`, `4v4`, and rush.

Upgrades are usually cheaper in the solo and doubles mode, however the base generator is slower.
