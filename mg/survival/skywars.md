# SkyWars

SkyWars is one of the most popular gamemodes on Hypixel. 

Each team is spawned on their own island. Kill other teams, with the aim of the game being the last team standing.

## Chests

There are two main categorys of chests, the ones on your starting island and the ones at mid. 

The ones on your spawn island can contain armour, swords, blocks and other essentials. However, the ones at mid contain higher value items such as diamond armour, better swords, or golden apples.

Chests on the spawn island and mid refill throughout the match, meaning you can get new items as the game progresses.

## Kits

You can purchase kits in the SkyWars lobby using the coins you earn throughout the match,

Kits include armoursmith, ecologist, knight, and much more.
